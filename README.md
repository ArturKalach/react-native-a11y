</div>

Native-first React Native accessibility toolkit for **both** screen reader focus order &
announcements (VoiceOver / TalkBack) **and** physical (external) keyboard support — on iOS
and Android. Everything ships under a single **`A11y.*`** namespace.

- 🔢 **Screen reader focus order** — define the exact traversal sequence, independent of render order
- 🃏 **Cards with inner buttons** — card action and nested controls, both accessible at once
- 🔒 **Focus lock** — keep VoiceOver, TalkBack, *and* keyboard focus inside modals & overlays
- 📣 **Announcements** — reliable, navigation-aware messages and screen/panel transitions
- 🎯 **Keyboard focus management** — focus/blur events, `autoFocus`, imperative focus via `ref`
- ⌨️ **Key press events** — handle key-down / key-up with full modifier info
- 🎨 **Native focus styling** — iOS halo & `tintColor`, Android focus highlight
- ✨ **Optimistic values** *(iOS)* — announce the predicted value the moment the user acts, not the stale one
- 📡 **Runtime status hooks** — `useIsKeyboardConnected`, `useIsScreenReaderEnabled`
- ⚡ New Architecture · Old Architecture · Bridgeless · Expo prebuild

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This package re-merges two focused libraries into one.** `react-native-a11y` was
> originally split — for easier development and support — into
> [`react-native-a11y-order`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-a11y-order)
> (screen reader) and
> [`react-native-external-keyboard`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-external-keyboard)
> (physical keyboard). Both are now mature, and this package recombines them under one
> unified `A11y.*` namespace. See [The rework](#the-rework) below.

> [!TIP]
> All three packages stay published and are **mutually exclusive** — install exactly one.
> Use `react-native-a11y` when you want **both** capabilities; use a split package if you
> only need one.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add react-native-a11y
cd ios && pod install
```

Get started with the [getting started guide](./docs/getting-started/getting-started.md)
or jump straight to the [component overview](./docs/components/overview.md).

## Quick start

Everything is imported from the single `A11y` namespace, with imperative APIs, hooks, and
the keyboard-focus HOC at the top level.

**Keyboard focus** — `A11y.Pressable`, `A11y.View`, and `A11y.Input` are drop-in,
keyboard-focusable views:

```tsx
import { A11y } from 'react-native-a11y';
import { Text } from 'react-native';

<A11y.Pressable
  autoFocus
  onPress={onPress}
  focusStyle={{ backgroundColor: 'dodgerblue' }}
>
  <Text>Press me with Space or Enter</Text>
</A11y.Pressable>;
```

**Screen reader order & announcements** — `A11y.Order` + `A11y.Index` define the traversal
sequence; `announce` posts a message:

```tsx
import { A11y, announce } from 'react-native-a11y';

<A11y.Order>
  <A11y.Index index={1}><Text>Read first</Text></A11y.Index>
  <A11y.Index index={3}><Text>Read third</Text></A11y.Index>
  <A11y.Index index={2}><Text>Read second</Text></A11y.Index>
</A11y.Order>;

announce('Changes saved');
```

`A11y.View` is one component that accepts **both** prop sets — give it keyboard props,
screen-reader props, or both. To add keyboard focus to a component the namespace doesn't
cover, wrap it with the [`withKeyboardFocus`](./docs/components/overview.md#withkeyboardfocus) HOC.

> [!NOTE]
> On iOS, long-pressing the spacebar does not fire a long press — iOS routes it through
> *Full Keyboard Access*. Use `Tab + M` (the default "open context menu" command) instead,
> via `onContextMenuPress`.

## The rework

The original all-in-one `react-native-a11y` (0.7.0) was **split** into two focused
packages to make each capability easier to develop, test, and support:

- [`react-native-a11y-order`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-a11y-order) — screen reader focus order & announcements
- [`react-native-external-keyboard`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-external-keyboard) — physical keyboard support

Feature work on both is now complete, and they are **recombined here** into a single,
self-contained `react-native-a11y` — rebuilt fresh from the two modern packages (whose
native bridges are newer than the legacy 0.7.0 code), not patched on top of the old one.

What this means for you:

- **One unified namespace.** A single `A11y.View` / `A11y.Pressable` / `A11y.Input` takes
  both screen-reader and keyboard props; each capability is opt-in. A single
  `A11y.FocusTrap` / `A11y.FocusFrame` confines screen-reader **and** keyboard focus.
- **Self-contained.** No runtime dependency on the two split packages — install only
  `react-native-a11y`.
- **Migration shim.** The imperative 0.7 focus-order API lives under
  [`Legacy.*`](./docs/api/legacy.md) for a near drop-in upgrade.

Coming from 0.7, `react-native-a11y-order`, or `react-native-external-keyboard`? Each path
has its own section in the [migration guide](./docs/migration/migration.md).
