# React Native A11y

**_NOTE:_**   Unfortunately, it is currently only for old architecture, we are working on migration to the new one.

A11y components and utils for RN. A11y is important, there are a lot of reasons to make your application accessible, at least requirements from customers.

`react-native-a11y` is a set of tools and components that will help make your application more accessible and provides additional solutions for working with `reader` (TalkBack/VoiceOver) and hardware `keyboard focus`. 


The components and utils of this library were developed to achieve WCAG 2.1 AA which can be different from standard mobile accessibility (especially for IOS).

 
This library does not change standard components , it only extends functionally, so you can install it to use some features in an already existing project or a new one.

## Installation
This library has not been published yet, but we plan to do it as soon as possible, right for now you can test the A11ySample app in the examples folder.

## Roadmap 
- Publish on npm
- Add examples and update samples
- Add tests
- Migrate to the new architecture
- Check React Navigation for A11y and make examples 

## Usage

Soon.
